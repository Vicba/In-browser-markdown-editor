# In-browser markdown editor

I found this challenge at frontendmentor.io [here](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/inbrowser-markdown-editor-r16TrrQX9).

I didn't want to spend a monthly subscription for this on the platform because I'm a broke student. So I took the idea and build it with my own twist. (Which is way more fun) ðŸ™ƒ

Right now, I like the current project state. It's quick and easy to use. I might add more features later if I change my mind.

- Doing side projects one hour a day after work isn't that hard, at the end of the week you see big results.
- Adding markdown to a project is easier then I thought.
- Refreshed my knowledge of Tailwind CSS and react context
- "Failing to plan is planning to fail." - Benjamin Franklin (but made it ðŸ˜ƒ)

## ðŸ˜® Features

Features that I could add if i had more time. Maybe some of them are too complex for the use case.

- auth
- making it full stack
- editing the file name (now only possible if you download file)
